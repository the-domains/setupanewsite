ELEARNING INDUSTRY 

Have you ever noticed how often the media portrays Baby Boomers as technological idiots? It's common for movies and TV shows to depict the generation born between 1946 and 1964 as utterly clueless when it comes to operating smart phones and laptops. Of course, those in the business world know that this is, for the most part, inaccurate. Some individuals sincerely dislike using technology and wish the pen-and-paper days would magically reappear. However, most people in the working world, no matter if they are Baby Boomers, Millennials, or from Generation X, find technology to be helpful and necessary to getting work done. This is especially true of eLearning technology.
